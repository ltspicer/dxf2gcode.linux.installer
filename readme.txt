Just start in the console with:
./linux.installer.sh
or double-click and select "run in terminal".
Then follow the instructions. The script will install all necessary packages and dxf2gcode automatically.

Python 3.7 or higher is required. This is checked by the script.
This script is tested on Debian 10 & 11 with GNOME, Linux Mint 20.3 MATE and Lubuntu 20.04.4 (LXDE)

The installation is ONLY complete when the script "dxf2gcode was successfully installed." spends in red!

Let me know if something doesn't work.

Download dxf2gcode: https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxf2gcode/files/latest/download

Unfortunately is the installation of Python3.7.3 or higher on Debian 9 (Wheezy) almost impossible.
Many LinuxCNC have Debian Wheezy :(
